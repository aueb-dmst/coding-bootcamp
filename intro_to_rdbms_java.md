# Introduction to Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) with Java

You have five days to get through the following material and solve
[Exercise 6](#exercise-6) below.

### Purpose: Introduction to RDBMSs

In about all web applications we need to store, retrieve, and
manipulate data. Data are stored using *databases*, the most common of
which adopt a specific formalism for dealing with data, the
*relational model*. Such a  database is called a *Relational Database
Management System* or RDBMS for short.

A modern RDMBS can handle terrabytes of data; it is a complicated
piece of software, to the point that administering a substantial
database can be a full time job. 

Here we will limit ourselves to the basics; fortunately, you do not
need to know a lot about databases to do a lot with them.

* The most popular open source, freely available RDBMs is MySQL. To
  get started with MySQL you must install it on your system. Follow
  the instructions in
  [Chapter 2 of the MySQL Reference Manual](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html).
  If you are using MS-Windows, make sure that in `Setup Type` you
  indicate that you want `Developer Default`. This will install the
  MySQL Workbench, with which you can interact with MySQL in a
  developer-friendly way. If you are using an Apple computer, or you
  want to install the MySQL Workbench separately, go to the [MySQL
  Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) and follow the
  instructions. In either case, watch the
  [Video Tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_umYKqKaF0). 

* For in-depth information on MySQL and related tools, head over to
  the [MySQL Documentation](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/). Of primary
  interest are the MySQL Server Reference Manual and the MySQL
  Workbench manual. 
  
* [Chua Hock Chuan](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=EHCHUA)
  has written a nice set of tutorials on MySQL. (Actually he has
  written several tutorials on various topics, check his
  [programming notes](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/).)
    * Start with the
      [How to Install MySQL](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/sql/MySQL_HowTo.html),
      but do not re-install MySQL, as you must have already installed
      it by now. However, do go over the material because he covers
      some necessary introductory stuff on databases and provides more
      details on what is really going on when you install and start
      MySQL.
    * Then read the [MySQL by Examples for Beginners](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/sql/MySQL_Beginner.html).

### Purpose: Relational Databases and Java

Once you have covered the basic of relational databases, you need to
know how you can work with them from inside a Java program. This is
done with an Application Programming Interface (API) called JDCB (for
Java Databse Connectivity).

* To learn how to use JDBC with Spring, read
  [Accessing Relational Data using JDBC with Spring](https://spring.io/guides/gs/relational-data-access/).
  You will notice that this guide does not use MySQL; for simplicity,
  it uses H2, an in-memory relational database engine.
  
* To learn how to use JDBC with MySQL, read
[An Introduction to Java Database (JDBC) Programming by Examples](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JDBC_Basic.html).

### Purpose: Java Persistence Architecture

You can do anything related to databases with JDBC, but there is a
drawback: your program will consist for both Java and SQL code, and
mapping between Java objects and SQL tables is not always intuitive.
We would much prefer to be able to interact with our RDBMS using only
Java. Enter Java Persistence Architecture (JPA), which allows us to
write Java code, which generates automatically the SQL code that is
required to work with our database.

This is the standard way we work with databases in web applications:
we use frameworks that allow us to write code in one language, be it
Python, Ruby, or Java, and they generate the SQL code to interact with
the database, so that we do not have to jungle with two languages at
the same time.

That said, knowing SQL is not useless. You must learn SQL to
understand what is really going on. Some times you may need to
investigate why some piece of code behaves a certain way; for
instance, it may be slow, and the reason could be that the underlying
SQL code generated by the framework is unyieldy. Also, we always need
to know how our database is organised in terms of tables. 

* Keeping this in mind, read
[Accessing Data with JPA](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/)
to get started with JPA.

### Exercise 6<a id="exercise-6"></a>

Just go over the material covered in this module and then:

* Continue the form that you developed in the
[First Steps in Dynamic Web Sites](first_steps_dynamic_sites.html) but
this time you should save the data entered by the user in a relational
database. You should also create another page that lists the records
that have been entered in the database so far. If you really want to
master Java and databases, give your page the capability to search
for records, or filter the records it displays based on criteria
entered by the user. Use JPA to speak to your database.
